# ZZ Linux Setup

ZZ Linux Setup is a modular, idempotent Linux post-install desktop bootstrapper for a minimal Niri + Noctalia Shell desktop with GTK-oriented applications and integration. Ghostty is the default terminal. `gum` provides the primary interactive wizard.

## Status

- Fedora is the primary target for v1.
- Arch Linux support is included as experimental.
- The design keeps distro-specific logic in thin adapters so additional distros can be added later without rewriting common modules.

## Desktop Philosophy

- Niri is the compositor/session target.
- Noctalia Shell is a shell layer, not a full desktop environment.
- GTK desktop defaults are the baseline:
  - Nautilus for file management
  - Neovim as the default handler for plain text and source files
  - Evince for PDFs and other document viewing
  - imv for lightweight image viewing
  - Satty-backed screenshots using the `grim` + `slurp` capture flow
  - GTK/GNOME portals, Noctalia's `polkit-agent` plugin, `adw-gtk3`, `qt5ct`/`qt6ct`, and Yaru icons
  - Noctalia's `gtk` and `qt` templates drive application color theming
- Ghostty is the default terminal.

## Session Model

- SDDM provides the graphical login and session chooser.
- Choose the `Niri` session at login.
- Noctalia is launched from Niri autostart with `spawn-at-startup "qs" "-c" "noctalia-shell"`.
- Noctalia ships with the Niri template pre-enabled through managed user settings.
- The default wallpaper is installed to `~/.local/share/wallpapers/SilentPeaks.jpg` and Noctalia is pointed at it through `~/.cache/noctalia/wallpapers.json`.
- `~/.config/niri` and `~/.config/noctalia` are stowed from this repo, so Niri config edits and Noctalia UI-saved settings show up as git changes.
- `~/.config/noctalia/plugins.json` enables Noctalia's built-in `polkit-agent` plugin from the official plugin source, so no separate session polkit binary is launched from Niri.
- Noctalia template activation is plan-aware: GTK/Qt are always enabled, the managed user templates render Neovim, Starship, and Zsh syntax highlighting against the active Noctalia scheme, Firefox theming is only enabled when Firefox is selected, and Zen Browser theming is only enabled when a Zen bundle is selected.
- The installer never starts SDDM immediately. Reboot to begin using the graphical login.

## Optional Shell Tooling

- The wizard exposes a `Shell / CLI tools` category for optional terminal utilities and prompt tooling.
- Current choices include `zsh`, `starship`, `zoxide`, `fastfetch`, `gh`, `btop`, `fd`, `fzf`, `bat`, and `yazi`.
- The Starship prompt layout is generated through Noctalia user templates, so its segment colors follow the current Noctalia theme instead of a fixed palette.
- Selecting `zsh` bootstraps Oh My Zsh, installs the managed `~/.zshrc`, and changes the target user's login shell to `/bin/zsh`.
- `doctor` checks the selected shell tools and their managed config files when they are present in the saved plan.

## Install

Remote install:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bgmulinari/zz-linux-setup/main/bootstrap.sh | bash -s -- --ref main
```

Pinned install:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bgmulinari/zz-linux-setup/main/bootstrap.sh | bash -s -- --ref v0.1.0
```

Local install:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bgmulinari/zz-linux-setup.git
cd zz-linux-setup
./install.sh wizard
```

Non-interactive install:

```bash
./install.sh install --yes --select browser=firefox,brave --select dev=base --select shell=zsh,starship,gh,fzf
```

Supported commands:

```bash
./install.sh wizard
./install.sh install --yes
./install.sh install --dry-run
./install.sh install --use-saved
./install.sh print-plan
./install.sh doctor
./install.sh list-profiles
./install.sh list-choices
./install.sh list-sources
```

## Idempotency

The project is intended to be safe to re-run after repository updates.

Managed items:

- package sources and repositories
- package installation
- Flatpak remotes and apps
- system services
- SDDM enablement
- managed dotfiles through `stow --restow`
- modular Niri config under `~/.config/niri/cfg/`
- MIME defaults and selected post-actions

Re-running should:

- install newly selected packages
- update managed files only when content changes
- re-enable required services if needed
- avoid duplicate repos, remotes, services, and stow entries

## Not Managed

- disk partitioning
- user creation
- Secure Boot setup
- automatic reboot
- starting SDDM immediately
- automatic AUR helper installation
- full desktop environment installation
- immutable Fedora Atomic support
- Debian, openSUSE, or NixOS support in v1

## Third-Party Source Warnings

- Fedora COPRs are optional or required depending on the selected component set. Review them before enabling.
- RPM Fusion is opt-in unless required by selected features such as codecs or Steam.
- AUR is required for Noctalia on Arch in this installer and depends on an existing `paru` or `yay`.
- Flathub is optional and is enabled explicitly or when a selected Flatpak requires it.
- Selecting `zsh` also fetches Oh My Zsh plus the `zsh-autosuggestions` and `zsh-syntax-highlighting` plugin repositories from GitHub.

## How To Extend

Add a package:

1. Put the package name in the appropriate distro/source manifest under `packages/`.
2. Reference that manifest from a choice file or the mandatory base plan.

Add a source:

1. Add a `.source` descriptor under `sources/<distro>/`.
2. Teach the relevant distro adapter how to enable it if it is a new source kind.
3. Reference the source ID from a choice file or base planner rule.

Add a wizard choice:

1. Add or update the relevant `choices/<distro>/*.conf` TSV.
2. Ensure referenced sources and manifests exist.
3. The planner will include it in `list-choices`, validation, and plan generation.

Add another distro:

1. Add `distros/newdistro.sh`.
2. Add `sources/newdistro/`.
3. Add `packages/newdistro/`.
4. Add `choices/newdistro/`.

The common modules should not need changes for a straightforward new adapter.

## Tests

Run:

```bash
./tests/smoke.sh
```

That covers shell syntax, parser tests, distro detection, planner expectations, and idempotency helper behavior.
