# DMS (DankMaterialShell) integration

This document records the design decisions behind the DMS desktop shell
integration: package ownership, theme seeding, greeter wiring, and the
first-run contract. It replaced the former Noctalia integration wholesale;
there are no compatibility or migration paths.

## Package and repository ownership

| Component | Package | Repository |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Shell + CLI | `dms` (pulls `dms-cli`, `dgop`) | COPR `avengemedia/dms` (stable channel) |
| Quickshell runtime | `quickshell` | COPR `avengemedia/danklinux` |
| Theming engine | `matugen` | COPR `avengemedia/danklinux` |
| Launcher file search | `danksearch` | COPR `avengemedia/danklinux` |
| Audio visualizer | `cava` | Fedora / COPR `avengemedia/danklinux` |
| Greeter | `dms-greeter` | COPR `avengemedia/danklinux` |
| Qt6 theming | `qt6ct-kde` | COPR `avengemedia/danklinux` |
| Terminal | `ghostty` | Terra |

DMS 1.6 embeds the Quickshell UI in the `dms` binary; the old
`/usr/share/quickshell/dms` payload is not a packaging contract. At runtime
the CLI materializes the UI under `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/danklinux-shell/`.
`dms_shell_dir` resolves the active revision from the structured
`dms doctor --json` result, which supplies both the `scripts/` appliers used
at first login and the `Common/settings` specs used by the seed-diff tool.

Repo-priority rules keep ownership deterministic. Each rule is declared as
an `excludepkgs` list on the source's own catalog TOML, compiled into
`sources.tsv`, and applied generically by `fedora_enable_sources`
(`lib/fedora.sh`) to the dnf repository the source enables — so a COPR
migration updates the ownership rule together with the source definition:

- `catalog/sources/terra/terra.toml` excludes
  `quickshell,quickshell-git,noctalia-qs,matugen,dgop,danksearch,dms,dms-cli,dms-greeter`
  so the DMS stack always resolves from the DankLinux COPRs (Terra also
  packages quickshell, and its `noctalia-qs` declares
  `Provides: quickshell`, which the solver would otherwise accept for the
  dms RPM's `(quickshell or quickshell-git)` dependency). `base-dms` also
  names `quickshell` explicitly so the real package is installed rather
  than trusting provider resolution of that boolean dependency.
- `catalog/sources/copr/avengemedia-danklinux.toml` excludes
  `ghostty,ghostty-shell-integration,ghostty-nautilus` so Terra always
  owns Ghostty (the COPR also builds it).

DMS bundles its UI fonts (Inter Variable, FiraCode Nerd Font, Material
Symbols Rounded) through Qt FontLoader, so no font packages are required
for the shell itself. DMS's clipboard manager, screenshot flow, lock
screen, idle daemon, notification daemon, OSD, and polkit agent are all
native, replacing the usual cliphist/wl-clipboard/swaylock/swayidle/mako
stack. The `dms.service` user unit takes the `org.freedesktop.Notifications`
bus name; never install another notification daemon alongside it.

## Launch path

DMS starts through its packaged systemd user unit (`dms.service`), but it
is never `systemctl enable`d: its `[Install]` section hooks
`graphical-session.target`, which every desktop activates, so enabling it
on a machine that also has GNOME or KDE would launch DMS inside those
sessions where it fights the native shell for the
`org.freedesktop.Notifications` bus. The wiring is data: `base-dms`
declares `user_wants = ["niri.service/dms.service"]` (and
`user_services = ["dsearch.service"]`) in its catalog unit, the planner
compiles the declarations of every planned unit into
`services/user-enable.list` and `services/user-wants.tsv`, and the
user-service machinery applies upstream's recommended scoping:
`systemctl --user add-wants niri.service dms.service` at first-run
(starting the unit immediately when the Niri session is already live),
with a `--global add-wants` fallback for the root/installer-chroot path.
There is deliberately no `spawn-at-startup` fallback: two launch
mechanisms mean double shells. `dsearch.service` (the danksearch indexer
feeding the spotlight launcher's file search; `WantedBy=default.target`,
harmless in any session) stays a plain enable, matching upstream
dankinstall. Readiness grades the binding by the wants symlink the two
`add-wants` scopes create (`~/.config/systemd/user/niri.service.wants/`
or `/etc/systemd/user/niri.service.wants/`) at warn severity — a
system-scope `is-enabled` cannot see a user binding, and before the first
login the binding legitimately does not exist yet.

The niri entrypoint includes every fragment DMS regenerates under
`~/.config/niri/dms/` — `dms/colors.kdl` (matugen), plus optional
`dms/layout.kdl`, `dms/alttab.kdl`, `dms/binds.kdl`, `dms/cursor.kdl`,
`dms/input.kdl`, `dms/outputs.kdl`, `dms/windowrules.kdl`, and
`dms/wpblur.kdl` — because
each Settings page gates itself on `dms config resolve-include` and goes
read-only when its fragment is not included. Fragment paths are written
without a `./` prefix: `KeybindsService` detects its own include with the
literal pattern `include.*"dms/binds.kdl"`, and the `./` form fails that
match, which makes DMS offer to "repair" the user-owned entrypoint by
backing it up and appending its own include line.

DMS 1.6 generates `dms/input.kdl` from its mouse, touchpad, and keyboard
settings. Those device directives live only in the generated fragment: DMS
represents disabled boolean options by omitting their KDL nodes, so an earlier
product-owned `tap`, `natural-scroll`, or `numlock` would prevent the Settings
toggle from turning it off. `cfg/input.kdl` retains only the behavior DMS does
not model (`focus-follows-mouse` and `workspace-auto-back-and-forth`). The
portable seed pins `keyboardNumlock = true` so moving ownership does not change
ZZ's default.

`dms/binds.kdl` is the *only* niri file the Settings → Keybinds page
reads. `dms keybinds show niri` parses that fragment alone, so binds kept
anywhere else — including a product-owned `cfg/keybinds.kdl` — are
invisible to the UI and the page renders empty. Including the fragment is
therefore necessary but not sufficient: the shipped keybinds have to live
*in* it.

So ZZ's keybind defaults are seeded into `~/.config/niri/dms/binds.kdl`
from `templates/niri/dms-binds.kdl`, and the niri defaults tree carries no
keybinds at all. DMS parses the seeded KDL directly, preserving
`hotkey-overlay-title`, `allow-when-locked`, `allow-inhibiting`, and
`cooldown-ms`, and sorts the binds into its own categories for display.

DMS's default-vs-override layering does not reach niri, so ZZ's seed
cannot act as a revertible default layer. The niri provider tags a bind
`dms-default` when it comes from `dms/binds.kdl` and `config` otherwise,
and never emits `dms` (`core/internal/keybinds/providers/niri.go`); the
Settings UI computes `isOverride` as `source === "dms"`
(`Services/KeybindsService.qml`). The Overrides filter is therefore always
empty on niri no matter what the seed contains or what the user changes.
Hyprland gets the two-layer model — `dms/binds.lua` for DMS defaults and
`dms/binds-user.lua` for overrides — and only its provider produces the
`dms` source. Consequently the per-bind "Reset to Default" action deletes
the bind on niri rather than restoring anything, despite prompt wording
that says the DMS default will re-apply. The supported revert is
whole-file: `zz refresh niri/dms/binds.kdl`. Revisit this if a DMS release
adds a niri user-override fragment.

This makes keybinds user-owned rather than product-owned, with two
consequences. Changed defaults no longer reach an existing install
automatically; `zz refresh niri/dms/binds.kdl` re-seeds them, backing up
the current file first. And the first edit made in the Settings UI
rewrites the whole fragment, discarding the seed's comments and section
grouping while keeping every bind — so the seed's layout is a
seed-time convenience, not a format DMS maintains.

The screenshot defaults use the DMS 1.6 native CLI (`dms screenshot`) rather
than the legacy niri IPC shim. Print selects a region, Ctrl+Print captures the
focused output, and Alt+Print captures the focused window; Mod+Shift+S remains
the alternate region shortcut. This keeps the shipped binds on the path that
supports 10-bit buffers, cross-output selection, last-region geometry, cursor
capture, and scroll capture.

Colors are DMS's alone: `dms/colors.kdl` loads after `cfg/layout.kdl`, so
any color set there is dead config.

Gaps are the opposite: DMS models its value as an *override* on top of the
niri config, so the product baseline belongs in `cfg/layout.kdl` rather than
being expressed as an override. Border widths look like the same case but are
not, and the difference decides where each value has to live:

- **Gaps.** Only `niriLayoutGapsOverride = -2`, the UI's "Off" mode, makes
  DMS omit its `gaps` line. `-1` ("Auto") is not a deferral — it writes
  `max(4, bar spacing)`, which is `4` under this bar. So the seed pins `-2`.
- **Border and focus-ring.** There is no equivalent off mode. DMS writes both
  widths unconditionally from `niriLayoutBorderSize`, falling back to `2` even
  when the UI's "Override Border Size" toggle is off, so a width in
  `cfg/layout.kdl` is always dead config. ZZ accepts the upstream `-1` default
  and therefore does not pin a redundant seed value. A different product
  width would have to be selected through the Settings UI or pinned in the
  seed.

DMS writes one width to both `border` and `focus-ring`, so the two cannot
differ once it is running.

Display configuration is DMS-owned through `dms/outputs.kdl` (Settings →
Displays); there is no separate manual display seed. When something must
beat the DMS-managed configuration, the user-owned `config.kdl`
entrypoint can declare an output block above the includes — niri uses the
first matching output section.

## Theme seeding

The default look is the official Catppuccin registry theme, mocha flavor
with the blue accent (latte + blue in light mode).

- `dotfiles/dms/.config/DankMaterialShell/themes/catppuccin/theme.json` is
  vendored from the official plugin/theme registry
  (https://github.com/AvengeMedia/dms-plugin-registry, `themes/catppuccin/theme.json`,
  commit `b65b029182b781c7d61ecfe1561eaae3fd059554`, 2026-08-21). To update
  it, fetch the same path from the registry HEAD, re-run
  `tests/dms_theme.bats`, and record the new commit here. Installing a
  registry theme is just placing its `theme.json` under
  `~/.config/DankMaterialShell/themes/<id>/`; the file is product-linked.
- `~/.config/DankMaterialShell/settings.json` is seeded once
  (seed-if-missing) with the theme selection keys
  (`currentThemeCategory: "registry"`, `currentThemeName: "custom"`,
  `customThemeFile`, `registryThemeVariants.catppuccin`), the managed mono
  font, and the Yaru-blue icon theme. Every other key falls back to the DMS
  defaults, and the Settings UI owns the file afterwards. The seed emitters
  and path/theme-fact helpers live in `lib/dms.sh`; the seeds, greeter
  staging, planner, first-run waits, and doctor checks all derive the DMS
  paths from it.
- `~/.local/state/DankMaterialShell/session.json` is seeded with the
  managed default wallpaper; dark mode and an empty pinned-app list inherit
  their upstream defaults and are not redundantly serialized.
- `dms_seed_state_files_if_missing` (`lib/dms.sh`) is the single writer
  for both seeds plus the `dms-colors.json` placeholder. The greeter
  action (module 30) runs before the post-actions seeding (module 80) and
  needs the files to exist for its cache symlinks, so it calls the same
  seeder — never a bare placeholder, which would block the real seeds
  behind the seed-if-missing guard.
- Static fallbacks bridge the gap until the shell first renders its matugen
  templates: `templates/ghostty/dankcolors` and
  `templates/niri/dms-colors.kdl` carry the same Catppuccin mocha/blue
  values as the generated `~/.config/ghostty/themes/dankcolors` and
  `~/.config/niri/dms/colors.kdl` that later overwrite them.
- qt6ct and kdeglobals point at the matugen-generated
  `~/.local/share/color-schemes/DankMatugen.colors` KColorScheme — the
  same wiring the Settings "Apply Qt Colors" button would write, so Qt
  apps follow the theme with no manual step.
- GTK/libadwaita apps follow the theme through the upstream one-time
  opt-in: the `dms-gtk-theme` first-run checkpoint runs the shell's own
  `scripts/gtk.sh apply` (what the Settings "Apply GTK Colors" button
  invokes) from the runtime-extracted shell payload. For GTK4 that imports
  the generated `dank-colors.css` from the user `gtk.css`; for GTK3 it
  copies adw-gtk3 into `~/.local/share/themes` and drops the global import,
  because the colors are appended to that copy by `gtk.sh patch`. The shell
  only runs `patch` after a matugen worker pass, and the worker does not run
  again at login while the theme is unchanged, so the checkpoint runs
  `patch` itself right after `apply` (plus the gtk-theme gsettings flip the
  shell uses to make running GTK3 apps reload). After that, DMS's automatic
  `patch`/regeneration passes keep GTK apps synchronized on every theme
  change.
- Flatpaks reach the same files through a global `flatpak override`
  applied at install time: `xdg-config/gtk-3.0` and `gtk-4.0` for the
  generated colors and the GTK4 import, `xdg-data/themes` so GTK3 apps find
  the patched adw-gtk3 copy ahead of the pristine `org.gtk.Gtk3theme`
  runtime extension, `xdg-config/qt6ct`, `xdg-config/kdeglobals`, and
  `xdg-data/color-schemes` for Qt. The host `QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME=qt6ct` is
  forwarded into sandboxes where no qt6ct plugin exists, so the override
  also sets `QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME=kde`: the KDE runtime's platform theme
  reads kdeglobals and the DankMatugen color scheme, giving Qt Flatpaks the
  palette host Qt apps use.
- The icon theme follows the accent automatically (ported from the
  previous shell's icon sync): a ZZ matugen drop-in
  (`~/.config/matugen/dms/configs/zz-icon-theme.toml` — DMS appends every
  `*.toml` in that directory, under its `configDir` of `~/.config`, to
  its merged matugen config) renders the primary color to
  `~/.cache/DankMaterialShell/icon-theme-accent`, and its post-hook runs
  `zz-sync-icon-theme`, which picks the hue-nearest Yaru variant and
  applies it to gsettings, qt6ct, kdeglobals, and the shell's own icon
  settings through the settings IPC. DMS itself covers the companion
  GNOME accent-color sync once its GTK theming is active.
- Editors select the matugen-generated themes by name: VS Code
  `Dynamic Base16 DankShell` (extension `danklinux.dms-theme`), Zed
  `DankShell Dark` / `DankShell Light`.
- Starship follows the theme through the same drop-in mechanism
  (`zz-starship.toml`): starship cannot include external files, so the
  palette renders to `~/.cache/DankMaterialShell/starship-palette.toml`
  and the post-hook `zz-sync-starship-palette` splices it into the
  marker-delimited `[palettes.zz]` block of the user-owned
  `starship.toml` (everything outside the markers is preserved; removing
  the markers opts out). The static palette in `templates/starship.toml`
  is the pre-first-render fallback.
- btop has no upstream DMS template and its `TTY` builtin leans on the
  terminal ANSI palette, whose generated slots are not a classic ramp; a
  ZZ matugen drop-in (`zz-btop.toml`) renders the managed
  `templates/btop/dank.theme`-shaped theme to
  `~/.config/btop/themes/dank.theme` (seeded statically as a fallback)
  and the btop config selects it as `dank`.
- Firefox theming (optional `browsers-firefox-theme` unit) uses Pywalfox:
  the native host is pip-installed per user (Fedora does not package it;
  the unit installs `python3-pip`, which Fedora's `python3` does not
  bundle), and `~/.cache/wal/colors.json` symlinks to the DMS template
  output `~/.cache/wal/dank-pywalfox.json`, the upstream-documented
  bridge. A pre-existing regular `colors.json` (a standalone-pywal
  palette) is backed up before the link replaces it.

## Plugins

ZZ ships DMS plugins from the checkout rather than through the plugin
registry: each plugin lives under
`dotfiles/dms/.config/DankMaterialShell/plugins/<Name>/` and is
product-linked as a whole directory into
`~/.config/DankMaterialShell/plugins/<Name>`. DMS lists a symlinked plugin
directory like a real one, and linking the directory (not each file) means
files added later reach existing installs on the next `zz update zz` without
new managed-config rows. The system tier under
`/etc/xdg/quickshell/dms-plugins` is deliberately unused: `system-file` mode
copies single files, so updates would stop flowing, and the user tier would
shadow it anyway.

Enablement is data DMS 1.6 keeps in
`~/.config/DankMaterialShell/plugin_settings.json`, keyed by plugin id. The
base `dms` component carries a `seed-if-missing` row for that file with no
source: it is rendered, like `settings.json`, by the DMS state seeding in
`lib/dms.sh` from `templates/dms/plugin-settings-seed.json`, which enables
every shipped plugin, minus the ids whose plugin component the plan left
out. One rendered seed on the base component is what lets two plugins share
the file (a managed-config path may appear only once) while a deselected
choice still seeds nothing for itself. DMS consults the flag only when it
discovers the plugin directory, which on a fresh install happens at first
login, after both the links and the seeds are in place.

Unlike the other seeds, plugin defaults are not one-shot: a plugin ZZ starts
shipping after an install is on by default there too. After the seeds,
post-actions runs `dms_apply_plugin_defaults` (`lib/dms.sh`), which adds the
planned ids the live `plugin_settings.json` lacks as enabled (every key the
user has set, disabled ones included, is kept), inserts each planned bar
widget into the live `settings.json` bar the way the seed places it (before
the first seed neighbor still in that section, else after the last
preceding one, else at the end, in the bar named `default`), and, when the
target user's shell answers IPC, asks it to rescan and enable the new ids so
they load without a re-login. A widget is placed once per plugin, recorded
in `~/.local/state/zz-fedora/dms-placed-widgets`, so a widget the user
removes afterwards stays removed; DMS watches both files, so a running
shell picks the edits up. The seed-diff tool does not cover plugin
settings, and `zz refresh` does not list the file (rendered seeds have no
source to restore from). A bar widget therefore needs its id in a
`barConfigs` section of `templates/dms/settings-seed.json` for both paths;
the settings emitter strips the ids of shipped plugins whose component is
not in the plan, because DMS lists an unresolved widget id as an
unavailable entry in the bar editor.

Shipped plugins:

- **ZZ menu** (`zzMenu`, base, component `dms`): the desktop's command
  menu, a composite plugin with a bar widget and a launcher surface. The
  bar button's popout is the menu proper (`ZzMenuPanel.qml`): groups open
  as submenus with a breadcrumb and a back arrow, the keyboard drives it
  (arrows, Enter, Backspace or Left to go up, Escape), and typing narrows
  the current group first and everything below it after that. Like the
  launcher it has two homes: the bar button drops it under the pill, and
  the Super+Z bind opens the same panel in a centered `DankModal` over a
  dimmed background through the shell's widget IPC
  (`dms ipc call widget toggleWith zzMenu root`; `openWith zzMenu <group>`
  opens a group). The rows: the `zz` commands, Niri chores the shell has no page
  for (edit the personal overrides, validate and reload the config, hotkey
  overlay, pick-a-window facts for window rules, outputs, compositor log), the shell itself
  (restart, rescan plugins, shell log), system monitors, and documentation
  links. The menu is data: `menu.json` in the plugin directory, an object
  keyed by dotted ids where the dots are the tree, overlaid entry by entry
  with `~/.config/zz-fedora/menu.json`. `scripts/zz-menu-inventory`
  (`/usr/bin/python3`, stdlib) merges the two, evaluates every `when` guard
  in one shell batch, expands the providers (`refresh` from
  `zz refresh --list`; `apps` from `zz app list --json`, one subgroup per
  category with rows that install or remove by state), and prints the groups
  (with their parent) and rows;
  `ZzMenuInventory.qml`, shared by both surfaces, runs it and the rows. The
  launcher surface behind the `zz` trigger is search only: the launcher
  closes after any plugin item executes and cannot hold a submenu open, so
  there each row carries its group path in the subtitle and as search
  words, and the top-level groups are the launcher's categories. A row
  marked `terminal` runs through `scripts/zz-menu-run`, which opens
  `xdg-terminal-exec` (falling back to `ghostty`) and holds the window
  until Enter so output and sudo prompts stay visible; other rows run
  detached in a login shell. It is base because a ZZ desktop without its
  own menu is incomplete and it needs no wizard visibility; the doctor
  reads its manifest through the link. A test keeps `menu.json` in step
  with `bin/zz.d/` and the updater's target list.
- **Agent usage** (`agentUsage`, unit `ai-agent-usage`, component
  `dms-plugin-agent-usage`): a bar pill plus popout showing Claude Code and
  Codex rate limits with reset countdowns, tokens per day for the last week,
  and the all-time token split by model. The widget only displays records:
  `scripts/update-usage` inside the plugin runs one stdlib-Python collector
  per agent (`/usr/bin/python3`, the unit's only package) and writes
  `~/.local/state/zz-fedora/agent-usage/<agent>.json`, which the QML watches
  through `FileView`. Claude limits come from Anthropic's OAuth usage
  endpoint with the signed-in CLI's token; Codex limits from the Codex
  app-server RPC. Both keep their last probe under
  `~/.cache/zz-fedora/agent-usage/` so a popout opened twice in a row does
  not probe twice and a failed probe keeps the last known numbers whose
  window has not reset. The pill collapses out of the bar until a record carries
  usage, which is why it sits in the default bar layout. Optional
  multi-device aggregation merges JSON snapshots from a user-chosen synced
  folder; rate limits are never merged.

## Greeter

`dms-greeter` (greetd), maintained in the standalone
`AvengeMedia/dank-greeter` repository since DMS 1.6, replaces the previous
shell-specific greeter. The
RPM scriptlets own the system heavy lifting (greeter user, SELinux
contexts, `/etc/pam.d/greetd`, greetd config creation/repair,
graphical.target). The `dms-greeter` action (`lib/actions/dms-greeter.sh`)
adds only what the package cannot know:

- installs the package pinned to the DankLinux COPR and re-asserts the
  greetd session config when a foreign config survived the scriptlet;
- replicates the root-side plumbing of upstream `dms-greeter enable`/`sync`
  for the target user (the upstream commands act on the *invoking* user, so
  they cannot be called from the root install path): `greeter` group
  membership, `g:greeter:rX` ACLs on the home traversal path and the DMS
  state dirs, the 2770 greeter-owned `/var/cache/dms-greeter{,/users}`
  cache, and the `settings.json`/`session.json`/`colors.json` symlinks into
  the user's live DMS state;
- enables greetd as the fallback graphical login, skipping (with a recorded
  skip) when another display manager is already enabled.

The sudo-free per-user preview slot (`dms-greeter sync --profile`) runs as
a first-run checkpoint once the user's shell state exists. The capability
probe remains as protection against an incomplete or independently packaged
greeter; without the command, the checkpoint completes and the greeter still
follows the theme through the cache symlinks.

## First-run contract

`modules/85-first-run.sh` keeps the independent-checkpoint model:

- `dms-theme` waits for the shell socket (`dms ipc call wallpaper get`) and
  then for the generated theme artifacts this install consumes (Ghostty
  `dankcolors`, `DankMatugen.colors`). There is no explicit "apply" IPC —
  DMS regenerates templates at startup and on theme changes — so artifact
  content is the completion signal: the Ghostty artifact is pre-seeded at
  the same path, so it only counts once its content diverges from the
  seed. Timeouts warn and retry at next login, bounded at three failed
  logins — after that the checkpoint completes with a warning instead of
  taxing every login, and the doctor checks surface the missing artifacts.
- `dms-gtk-theme` resolves the embedded shell's runtime payload and runs its
  `gtk.sh apply` followed by `gtk.sh patch` once the generated GTK colors
  exist, applying the same one-time GTK opt-in as the Settings button plus
  the GTK3 color patch the shell would otherwise defer to the next theme
  change, so GTK theming is automatic from the first login.
- `dms-greeter-profile` runs `dms-greeter sync --profile` unless the
  greeter action (or its user sync) was skip-recorded.

## Verification surface

- `tests/dms_theme.bats` + `tests/support/dms_theme.py` validate the
  vendored theme.json (structure and WCAG contrast on the flavor/accent
  pairs).
- `tests/dms_plugins.bats` + `tests/support/dms_plugin.py` validate the
  shipped plugin manifests against the upstream schema, the catalog wiring,
  the enablement seed, and the collectors against fixture transcripts.
- `tests/packages_orchestration.bats` covers the greeter action;
  `tests/post_actions.bats` covers the seeds and first-run checkpoints;
  `tests/fedora_sources.bats` covers the COPR/Terra ownership rules.
- `dms doctor` runs best-effort in `zz doctor` diagnostics.
