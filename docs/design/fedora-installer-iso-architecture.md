# Fedora Installer ISO Architecture

This design note records how the installer ISO is put together and why. For
the user-facing build, install-flow, and VM-validation procedure, see
[docs/fedora-installer-iso.md](../fedora-installer-iso.md).

The implementation follows Fedora/Lorax's Kickstart ISO approach:

- When no input path is supplied, the build-time tooling refreshes Fedora's
  official `releases.json`, selects the highest stable numeric Everything
  release for x86_64, and caches that netinst image under the ignored
  `release/input/` directory. The matching checksum document is cached
  alongside it, while Fedora's aggregate OpenPGP keyring is refreshed on each
  build. The builder authenticates the checksum document with `gpgv`, derives
  the expected signer from the locally installed certificate for the resolved
  release, and compares the input SHA-256 with both signed and release-metadata
  values; an invalid cached input or checksum document is replaced and
  rechecked. When no output
  path is supplied, the builder derives
  `release/zz-fedora-<architecture>-<release>.iso` from the validated input ISO
  metadata.
- `mkksiso` adds a Kickstart and extra files to an existing installer ISO and
  updates the boot configuration to run that Kickstart.
- A generated `images/product.img` contains the Anaconda add-on payload under
  `/usr/share/anaconda/addons/`, matching Red Hat's documented installer
  customization layout. The product image also includes a fallback snapshot of
  the `catalog/` tree for add-on development and diagnostics. During an ISO
  install, the spoke renders the catalogs from the refreshed remote runtime
  instead.
  It also installs an Anaconda configuration snippet that hides the built-in
  `SoftwareSelectionSpoke`; all optional setup choices are made in the
  `ZZ Fedora` spoke under Anaconda's existing Software section.
- The product image installs D-Bus policy and service activation files for
  `org.fedoraproject.Anaconda.Addons.ZZFedora`. Anaconda starts that module
  with its other add-ons, collects its `install_with_tasks()` task, and displays
  the task's `report_progress()` messages in the normal installer progress UI.
- Product-image content is split by kind: `iso/anaconda-addon/` holds the
  Python add-on payload, and `iso/anaconda-addon-data/` holds every non-Python
  file staged into the product image — the D-Bus policy and activation files,
  the `conf.d` snippet, and the `.buildstamp` template. The build scripts only
  stage these tracked files and substitute release-derived values such as
  `@FEDORA_RELEASE@`; they do not embed product-image content inline. The
  staged add-on additionally carries a generated `build-info.conf` stamp
  recording the Git revision (and dirty state) of the checkout that produced
  the image, so an installed ISO can be correlated with repository state.
- The Kickstart leaves disk partitioning, locale, timezone, hostname, root
  password, user creation, and ZZ Fedora execution to Anaconda.
- The Kickstart starts from Fedora's bootable core and hardware-support group,
  then adds only the Workstation platform pieces not otherwise guaranteed by
  the managed desktop: standard utilities, NetworkManager submodules, printing
  support, guest agents, Thunderbolt device authorization, extra kernel modules
  and tools, camera and scanner backends, Intel video and QAT runtimes,
  driverless and Braille printing helpers, hybrid-GPU switching, Vulkan
  drivers, thermal support, and UDisks Btrfs integration. The catalog declares
  the same additions for normal post-install bootstraps, so hardware support
  does not depend on which Fedora edition the user started from. Hardware-facing
  Workstation recommendations are rooted explicitly because DNF need not revisit
  weak dependencies of packages already present on the target. In particular,
  Workstation obtains `bolt` indirectly from GNOME package recommendations, not
  from the hardware-support group, and the Niri stack has no equivalent
  dependency edge.
- The embedded checkout is a tracked runtime snapshot, not a copy of the
  developer repository's `.git` directory. It provides the stable loader that
  refreshes `main` before the ZZ Fedora choices become available.
- The graphical and text add-on spokes wait for Anaconda's installation-source
  setup to reach a terminal state before downloading the current remote
  archive. This lets users configure Wi-Fi, static networking, or a source
  proxy through Anaconda first. A failed refresh leaves the mandatory spoke
  incomplete and re-entering it retries the download.
- The loader (`iso/lib/runtime-loader.sh`, executed inside Anaconda by the
  add-on) first probes the repository host with a short connection timeout so
  an installer without a route out fails within seconds. It then resolves the
  ref through the repository's git ref advertisement
  (`info/refs?service=git-upload-pack`), downloads GitHub's archive of that
  exact commit, and rejects an archive whose top-level directory does not end
  in the resolved commit id. Both are plain requests against `github.com`, so
  the refresh neither depends on the REST API nor counts against its
  unauthenticated per-address rate limit.
- The loader filters the archive to the runtime paths declared by that
  revision's `iso/payload-paths.conf` and stages it at
  `/run/zz-fedora/repository`. The manifest covers only what the spokes and
  the install task read from the snapshot: the catalogs, the installer
  libraries, and the revision marker inputs. The wallpapers are excluded
  because the install runs from a fresh clone, not from the snapshot, and the
  repository's `.gitattributes` marks `assets/wallpapers` `export-ignore`,
  which GitHub honors when building archives, so the download itself stays
  small. Failure to fetch or validate the snapshot stops the installation
  instead of silently using stale catalogs. If TLS validation reports an
  invalid installer clock, the loader uses chronyd to synchronize time and
  repeats the fetch once. The embedded manifest is used only when refreshing
  from an older revision that predates the manifest.
- Both the graphical and text spokes derive the choice catalogs from the
  refreshed snapshot's `catalog/` tree through the shared `lib/catalog.py`
  parser. New units, choices, and categories are discovered without
  rebuilding the ISO. The add-on later creates a depth-1 clone at `~/.zz` for
  the first regular user created in Anaconda, verifies it against the exact
  revision recorded by the refreshed payload, and runs the installer from that
  full Git checkout. Git is part of the initial Kickstart package set so the
  checkout is available before the add-on task starts.
- The add-on writes the chosen desktop app profile and optional packages to
  the normal saved selection format. The installer is invoked with
  `--use-saved`, the selected `--desktop-app-profile full|minimal`, and
  user-scoped state paths so the result matches the selected baseline plus the
  Anaconda choices.
- The Kickstart enables Anaconda's built-in `updates` repository by name. This
  makes Anaconda resolve its original package transaction against both the
  Fedora release and current updates repositories, matching the online
  Everything installer without a second full-system upgrade transaction.
  The repository is intentionally not redefined with `--metalink`: Anaconda
  disables built-in repositories while loading an explicit URL source, and a
  URL redefinition of the existing `updates` repository does not re-enable it.
